        <p class="pandatip">PandaTip: These Website Standard Terms and Conditions provide some of the basic terms and conditions found on many websites. Certainly, the specifics of your website may call for additional terms and conditions. If yours is a website with just text and images, which owned by the Website, and your users are merely viewing and reading the contents of your website, you will likely need less extensive terms than someone who owns a more interactive website, which hosts personally identifiable information. Make sure to engage an attorney in the review of any terms and conditions you develop for your particular website.</p>
